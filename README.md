# PCS211 – Physics: Mechanics

**Institution:** Toronto Metropolitan University  
**Course Code:** PCS211  
**Focus:** Classical Mechanics, Forces, Kinematics, Dynamics

---

## 📘 Course Overview

PCS211 provides a foundational understanding of classical mechanics with a focus on engineering applications. The course emphasizes both theoretical and applied aspects of force systems, motion, and equilibrium. Students learn to model and solve real-world physical problems using vector analysis and Newtonian principles.

### Topics Covered:
- 2D/3D vector mechanics and force systems  
- Moments and couples, static equilibrium  
- Free-body diagrams and structural analysis  
- Particle kinematics and Newton’s laws  
- Friction, normal forces, and tension systems  
- Work-energy and impulse-momentum principles  
- Rigid body dynamics and mass properties
